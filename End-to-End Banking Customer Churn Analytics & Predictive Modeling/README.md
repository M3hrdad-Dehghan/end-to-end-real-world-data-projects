## 🧠 Business Problem

In the highly competitive banking industry, customer retention is a key driver of profitability. Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. However, many banks lack a structured, data-driven approach to proactively identify customers at risk of churn. 

---

## 🎯 Objective 

The ultimate goal was to enable the bank to proactively identify high-risk customers and optimize retention strategies. The objective of this project was to:
-	Analyze historical customer and account data to understand key drivers of churn
-	Statistically validate relationships between customer attributes and churn behavior
-	Build a predictive machine learning model to estimate churn probability
-	Develop an interactive Tableau dashboard to support retention decision-making

---

## 📊 Data & Inputs

- The project utilized structured relational banking data stored in SQL Server and modeled into normalized tables:
-	Demographic, Account and Locations Table

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

- Designed relational data model (Demographic–Account–Location)
-	Created ERD and implemented schema in SQL Server and Performed advanced SQL EDA
-	Built reusable preprocessing functions in Python for Data type validation, Missing value checks, Categorical sanity checks & Distribution and outlier Detection
-	Statistical Hypothesis Testing (Independent Samples t-test, Chi-Square Test of Independence, ANOVA, Effect Size Metrics)
-	Performed feature engineering and feature scaling to preprocess data
-	Implemented different ML prediction algorithms to find the best model as a baseline model
-	Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard based on stakeholder requirements

---

## 🛠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- End-to-end data science workflow (SQL, Python, Statistical Inference, ML, Tableau)
-	Relational data modeling & SQL analytics
-	Statistical hypothesis testing in real-world business context
-	Feature engineering driven by statistical validation
-	Predictive modeling for churn classification
-	BI dashboard design aligned with stakeholder requirements
-	Translating data insights into actionable business strategy
