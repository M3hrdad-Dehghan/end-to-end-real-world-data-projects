## 🧠 Business Problem

Sports analytics requires reliable, well-structured data pipelines to transform raw match and league data into analytics-ready datasets. 

---

## 🎯 Objective 

The objective of this project was to design an end-to-end data pipeline that automates data ingestion, transformation, and storage for football league analytics and reporting.

---

## 📊 Data & Inputs

- Raw football league datasets including match results, teams, standings, and performance statistics
- Structured relational data processed using SQL-based transformations
- Data stored and processed across cloud-based storage and compute services

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

- Designed and implemented a full SQL-based ETL pipeline to clean, normalize, and transform raw football data into analytics-ready tables
- Applied performance-optimized SQL queries to handle joins, aggregations, and historical transformations efficiently
- Integrated the pipeline with cloud services to support automated scheduling, scalable processing, and secure data storage
- Prepared processed datasets for downstream analytics, dashboards, and reporting use cases
